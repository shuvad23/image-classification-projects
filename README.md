# image-classification-projects
This project implements an image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in PyTorch. The model is trained on labeled image datasets to automatically recognize and classify objects into predefined categories. It demonstrates end-to-end deep learning workflow including data loading, training, and evaluation.
